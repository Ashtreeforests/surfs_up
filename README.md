# Surfs_Up Analysis
## Project Description
Use SQLite and SQLAlchemy to perform a weather analysis of climate data. Climate App building using Flask. Other tools include Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Project Resources
* SQLite
* SQLAlchemy
* Python
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Visual Studio 

SQLAlchemy was used to connect and generate queries from the data in SQLite database. Jupiter notebook was utilized to import dependencies and create the commands to pull the data from the SQLite database. Visual Studio was used to create and share results via Flask route.

## Project Overview
For this project, we performed an analysis of the weather conditions dataset that has been stored in a SQLite database. The goal is to be able to provide information for investors to open a Surf n' Shake shop in Oahu, Hawaii. Weather conditions are relevant analysis for investors as this shop would sell surf boards and ice cream year road. It was reported that a similar business had previously failed as a result of weather conditions. 

## Project Results
### Precipitation 
* Precipitation results for a one year timeframe: August 23, 2016 - August 23, 2017 
* Average of 18% based on 2,021 observations 
* Assessment is that on average, throughout the year, Oahu is mostly sunny with minimal rainfall

### Temperature 
* Weather stations actively collect precipitation & temperature data. 
* 9 stations showed the highest amount of observations at 2,772 entries
* Results for the same one year timeframe yielded an average temperature of 72°F 
  * Low of 54°F
  * High of 85°F

### Expanding the Results
Additional results after the timeframe was expanded to include June & December, regardless of year.

* Average temperature ranged in the 70's.
* Both June and December reflected similarities in their minimum & maximum and average temperatures
* Assumption based on these results is that temperature does not dramatically fluctuate throughout the year

## Project Summary
Based on the results of this analysis, Oahu's temperature throughout the year remains moderately steady with low changes of continuous rainfall. If we were to factor in the chance of increased rainfall for June and December, the average precipitation in those months showed:

Our recommendation from these results is that precipitation and temperature maintain a relative range that is compatible with the investment in the Surf n' Shake shop at Oahu, Hawaii. 

### Expanding the Results
For a more robust analysis, we expanded the analysis to include data from March and September of the weather conditions at Oahu, Hawaii. The results of this analysis expansion identified the heightened probability of increased rainfall from December to March. However, temperatures maintained relative stability during this time. Expanding the results does not dispute the recommendation for investment in the Surf n' Shake shop at Oahu, Hawaii from the perspective of weather conditions.
